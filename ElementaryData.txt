1. Array (Static Array)
Benefits:

Fast random access O(1) via index

Memory efficient (contiguous, no pointers overhead)

Excellent cache locality

Simple implementation

Disadvantages:

Fixed size (static arrays) or expensive resizing (dynamic arrays)

Insertion/deletion in middle is O(n) (shifting required)

Wasted space if allocated too large, insufficient if too small

2. Linked List (Singly/Doubly)
Benefits:

Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed)

O(1) insertion/deletion at known position (with pointer)

No shifting needed for insert/delete in middle

Memory allocated as needed

Disadvantages:

No random access O(n) for traversal to position

Extra memory for pointers (overhead per node)

Poor cache performance (nodes scattered in memory)

More complex to implement and debug

3. Stack (LIFO)
Benefits:

Simple and efficient for LIFO operations

O(1) push/pop operations

Useful for recursion, parsing, undo operations

Can be implemented simply with array or linked list

Disadvantages:

Limited access (only top element accessible)

Not suitable for random access needs

Can overflow (array implementation) or underflow

4. Queue (FIFO)
Benefits:

Efficient for FIFO processing

O(1) enqueue/dequeue (with proper implementation)

Essential for scheduling, buffering, BFS

Fair ordering (first come first served)

Disadvantages:

Limited access (only front and rear)

Array implementation: circular queue needed to reuse space

Linked list implementation: pointer overhead

Not suitable for random access
